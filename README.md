# Limitations
1. logisim has a 24 bit limit for address for RAM components
1. logisim doesn't support byte addressing - only word addressing.

# About this library
1. The RAM closest to the clock will be used to hold the instructions
1. the other RAM will hold the static data, dynamic data, and stack
1. program starts at address 0
1. stack pointer has initial value: 0x100 0000 (2^24)
1. static data starts at 0 (uses the other RAM component)
1. The program can only end by falling off the end of the program (no support for syscalls)
1. jump addresses are restricted to 24 bits because of the logisim RAM address size limitation
1. the pc is incremented by 1 (instead of 4)

# Testing
1. CircTest - tests machine code vs a logisim circuit execution
1. MipsParserTest - tests parsing mips code into machine code
1. MipsRegressionTest - tests mips parser as well as logisim circuit execution
